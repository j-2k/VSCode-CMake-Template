# VSCode-CMake-Template
Visual Studio Code CMake template to get started fast for C++, I will use this for my mac mainly.

#### Requirements
  - C++ Extension in VSC to support IntelliSense & extra stuff
    - You need to have the vscode folder in the root to make sure the intellisense is not giving you errors. For example, iostream was being flagged as not being detected but ofcourse it compiles fine with make, so make sure vscode is auto generated or you have to configure it manually.
  - CMake Tools Extension in VSC
  - Xcode command line tools might also be required if you are using Mac

# Compiling C++ with CMAKE
For compiling, use cmake through the VSC extension or just use cmake CLI.
